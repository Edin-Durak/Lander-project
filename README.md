# First Upwork Job

This project was my first Figma to HTML/CSS conversion. The client provided me with 6 different images, and he wanted me to change them depending on the width of the screen.

Using the code below, I was able to deliver what the client wanted from me.

```html
<img srcset="
          images/360.png   599w,
          images/600.png   600w,
          images/960.png   960w,
          images/1280.png 1280w,
          images/1600.png 1600w,
          images/1920.png 1920w
        " sizes="100vw" src="images/1920.png" alt="Space Sheep" class="header-img">
```

With fast delivery time, he was very satisfied with the result.
