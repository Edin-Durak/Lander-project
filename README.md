# First Upwork Job

This project was my first Figma to HTML/CSS conversion. 
Client provided me with 6 different images and he wanted me to change them depending of the width of the screen. 

Using code below I was able to deliver what client wanted from me.
<img srcset="
          images/360.png   599w,
          images/600.png   600w,
          images/960.png   960w,
          images/1280.png 1280w,
          images/1600.png 1600w,
          images/1920.png 1920w
        " sizes="100vw" src="images/1920.png" alt="Spase Sheep" class="header-img">

With fast delivery time he was very satisfied with the result.
